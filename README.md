## Project Overview
Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network.

COCO dataset 2017, being reshaped to 320x240 was used for training, but not exclusive to this dataset. Anyone can add a dataset with a proper path defined.

This is inspired and adapted from the medium article https://medium.com/@birla.deepak26/single-image-super-resolution-using-gans-keras-aca310f33112, and the mentioned git repo in the article, which I tried to compile to a Jupyter notebook.

## Requirements

Python 3.5.4,
tensorflow 1.11.0,
keras 2.2.4,
numpy 1.10.4,
matplotlib, skimage, scipy
